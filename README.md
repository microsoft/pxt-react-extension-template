THIS KIND OF EXTENSION WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED IN FUTURE VERSIONS OF MAKECODE.

# A MakeCode Extension

This template contains the boiler plate code to create
a MakeCode Extension that exposes a custom page in the editor.

## Creating the extension

Follow these steps carefully to setup your extension for MakeCode.

### Updating info in the sources

- [ ] search and replace all instance of "pxt-extension-name" with the repo name
- [ ] search and replace all instance of "githubid" with the GitHub organization of the repo
- [ ] update the ``pxt.json`` fields: ``name``, ``description``, extension ``namespace``
- [ ] search for all ``TODO`` strings and update descriptions

### Build

- [ ] install Node.
- [ ] To build the repo, run:

```
npm install
```

### Launch the Development Server

- [ ] After this you can run the dev server

```
npm run start
```

This will be running on http://localhost:3000

You can edit your React app under ``src`` and the dev server will hot reload it in the browser. Unless you change styles, you generally don't have to reload it to see your changes during development.

When running locally in a web browser, and not in an iframe, read and write operations are stored in localStorage to make debugging easier.

Webpack will generate the bundled app js when running ``npm run start`` or ``npm run deploy``

This repo uses [semantic-ui-react](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React) as the UI framework, but you can substitue it with any

### Deploy

- [ ] To deploy your extension to Github pages, run:

```
npm run deploy
```

### Try it out

- [ ] Once built, the extension will be hosted on GitHub pages.

https://githubid.github.io/pxt-extension-name

- [ ] Go to the MakeCode editor and add this repo as an extension to a project, 
you should see your button show up in the desired namespace.
